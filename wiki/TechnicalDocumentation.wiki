#summary Technical documentation of the whole architecture

= Introduction =
This wiki page provides information about building the project from the source code, because it is an open-source and provided you accept the licence agreement you are allowed to do that. It also gives the information about code separation into particular maven modules, information about used technologies, security aspects, etc.

== Building form Source Code ==

From architectural perspective, the editor is divided into several Maven modules forming the modular system. The whole application can be build from source code by running one of the following command on the top-lvl maven module.
{{{
mvn install # default build (hostname = editor.mzk.cz)
mvn install -Dfilter.hostname=hostnameXY #for specific deployment
mvn install -P dev # development profile will shorten the compilation time by omitting gwt permutation for specific locales and browsers
}}}

Unfortunately, a few libraries are not present at any public Maven repository, thus user have to install them manually. They are located at https://github.com/moravianlibrary/MEditor/tree/master/resources/lib and in the main (top-lvl) pom.xml, there should be some description how to do this.

After the project is successfully built, the war is located at the directory called "target" and can be deployed to any servlet container (neither EJB nor Spring was used and all the libraries except jdbc driver are provided in the web archive).

If you have the war file ready for the deployment, you can continue with InstallationNotes.


== Code Separation ==
As mentioned above, the Editor uses the Maven build system and the related classes are situated int the same Maven module. In general there are different approaches how to separate the project into particular projects. One can take the layer approach, one can take the feature based approach, we are probably somewhere between the two. Some modules are feature based (like editor-{creation|editation|user}) some are more layer based like editor-dao.

Here is a short description to the modules:
